This is where I'll share the Lilypond files I use for contributing to IMSLP.

Feel free to contribute to this as well.

Currently, I'm working on Holst's First Suite in E-flat. I've other bits of Lilypond elsewhere so at some point, I'll resume work on them. I'm also working on redoing a score I previously typeset with LilyPond in 2011 to improve the work I did on it.
