This is where I'll share the Lilypond files I use for contributing to IMSLP, the [International Music Score Library Project](http://imslp.org/).

Feel free to contribute to this as well if so inclined.

Currently, I'm working on Arban's etudes for trumpet and other brass. I've other bits of Lilypond elsewhere so at some point, I'll resume work on them. I'm also working on redoing a score I previously typeset with LilyPond in 2011 to improve the work I did on it.
