This is where I'll share the Lilypond files I use for contributing to IMSLP, the [International Music Score Library Project](http://imslp.org/).

Feel free to contribute to this as well.

Currently, I'm working on [Holst](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gustav_Holst)'s [*First Suite in E-flat*](http://imslp.org/wiki/First_Suite_for_Military_Band,_Op.28_No.1_%28Holst,_Gustav%29). I've other bits of Lilypond elsewhere so at some point, I'll resume work on them. I'm also working on redoing a score I previously typeset with LilyPond in 2011 to improve the work I did on it.

The LilyPond files are released [Creative Commons Attribution ShareAlike 4.0 International](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) license, meaning you are free to reuse and modify them so long as you give proper attribution.
